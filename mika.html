    <p <em style="color:#FFE4B5;">Muscovite is a well-known group of silicate minerals with outstanding physical features. one of the most common feature is the crystals that forms which gives Mica its name "Beautiful Dirt" since it can be found on eithers crust and can be easily spillted into thin elastic plates.
    Varieties of Mica can be found all over the world,but over 50% of the world mika comes form India.Basically where all cnsumers of mica gets their product form. MIca is used for cosmetics, filler in cement asphalt, and as insulation material in electric cables, edible glitters, inks, paints.</em> </p>

    <p style="color:#FFE4B5;">                                                       Mica chemical name is Hydrated aluminum potassium silicate, It's commonly formed by crystallization of magma(molten and semi-molten rock mixture from the surface of the earth) from hot gasses including vapors(pneuma), and hot solution. This process is called Muscovite it can also be found in granites, pegmatites, gneisses, and also schists.</p>
    <em style="color:#FFE4B5;"> The chemical formula for mica is KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,OH)2.<img src="ch.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;""></em>
    <h2 style="color:chocolate;">History of mica</h2>
    <img src="med.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;""><img src="cav.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;""><img src="may.jpeg" style="width:150px;height:150px;"">
  <p style="color:#FFE4B5;"> Mica has minded in India over 4,000 years ago, it was used by Egyptians. Greek, Roman, and Chinese Civilizations. The earliest trace of it was found in cave paintings, it was also used for medicines and the Mayans used it for a creative effect it put it on their temples that would face upward to the sun which gave it a sparkler effect.</p>
  <h4 style="color:#FFE4B5;"> Mica=Chemistry </h4>
  <p style="color:#FFE4B5;"> The two things I would connect mica to that I learned in chemistry is the Characterization of the properties that describe solutions and chemical compound of mica, and one more thing the weight of molecular which is so cool because we recently just were leanring about it and still are. </p>
